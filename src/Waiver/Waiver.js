                                Ayurvedic Practitioners are <strong>NOT</strong> licensed physicians, nor are Ayurveda services licensed by the state. Ayurveda is a traditional medicine originating in India and emphasizes maintaining the harmony of body-mind-spirit through diet, lifestyle, and natural herbs. In Ayurveda the emphasis is not on disease but on maintaining the balance of the individualâ€™s constitutional nature. So Ayurvedic treatments are never one size fits all, but custom tailored for each individual. As a practitioner of Ayurveda I will provide you assessments and recommendations in the following areas:

If you ever have any concerns about the nature of your treatment, please feel free to discuss them with me. It is recommended that you inform your medical doctor that you are receiving Ayurvedic treatment.
